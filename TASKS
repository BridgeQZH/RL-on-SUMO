### Sumo related
1) Shut up the warning messages of sumo.
2) Write a more smart and clean wrapper class to sumo environment.
3) Write a convinient function which gives this info: Num_of_intersections,
State size for each intersection, number of actions for each intersection.

### RL Related
1) Code different reward functions. Wait time is may be not the optimal.

### Agent related
1) Now the agent works with only one intersection. Need to add a TOP_Agent which holds multiple Agents for each intersection.
2) Number of lanes and state size is hard-coded. IT should be derived from the environment in real-time.
3) Code a manual agent which changes phases by ket press.
done: 4) Code cyclic agent for comaprison
5) Code Dueling DQN Agent
5) Coda Policy Gradients Agent
6) Code A2C Agent
7) Add option to Save model and load checkpoint

### Utils
1) Write convinient script to conduct experiments.
